# Bhairagini AI

****PLEASE NOTE: This project is still in progress, files are in the process of being uploaded as we speak. Please check other available projects on this [link.](https://github.com/HarryLMoss) Thank you for your patience.***

## Overview
Bhairagini AI is an innovative project blending the timeless principles of Indian classical music, as outlined in the Sangita Ratnakara and Natya Shastra, with contemporary, modern music genres. This AI-driven system generates therapeutic music, adhering to rules and guidelines from Indian classical music theory, tailoured for modern listeners through genres like Trap, EDM, Rock, Pop, Hip-hop, and Ambient. The scope of this project is to bridge the gap between both modern and classical music therapy with current trends in AI/ML.

## Features
- **Genre Fusion**: Seamlessly combines Indian classical music with contemporary genres to produce unique therapeutic compositions.
- **Therapeutic Focus**: Leverages the science of Raga therapy, using specific Ragas to target specific psycological and even physiological ailments.
- **Dynamic MIDI Output**: Generates MIDI files compatible with major DAWs, enabling easy integration into music production workflows.

## Technologies Used
- Python for AI model development and orchestration.
- C++ and the JUCE framework for real-time audio processing and MIDI generation.
- GPT-4 for automated data analysis and understanding musical principles from ancient texts.
- Docker for containerisation and easy deployment.

## How It Works
1. **Data Analysis**: Utilises GPT-4 to extract and summarise musical principles from Sangita Ratnakara and Natya Shastra.
2. **Model Training**: Leverages deep learning to fuse traditional and contemporary music elements based on extracted principles.
3. **Music Generation**: Generates MIDI sequences in real-time, adhering to the selected fusion genre and therapeutic guidelines.
4. **DAW Integration**: MIDI output is compatible with DAWs like Logic Pro for further manipulation and production.
